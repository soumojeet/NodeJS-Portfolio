      microcontroller processes sensor data and sends it to the Blynk cloud-based platform, where users can monitor and control the system 
      remotely using a smartphone application. The relay module controls the water pump, which irrigates the plants when the soil moisture 
      level is low and it is not raining. The system also provides real-time updates on soil moisture, rainfall, and temperature, allowing 
      users to adjust the irrigation settings as needed. This system aims to promote sustainable agriculture and save water resources while 
      ensuring optimal plant growth.`,
